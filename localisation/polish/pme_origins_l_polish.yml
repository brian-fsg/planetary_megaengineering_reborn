origin_pme_late_ftl_desc:0 "Your species has focused on improving the surface of their homeworld for far longer than the average civilization. This has resulted in a higher population on your homeworld and far better-developed infrastructure than most fledgling interstellar nations. \n \n Unfortunately, a large accident during the construction of two planetary megastructures has resulted in both being ruined, leaving a large swath of territory unusable until it's cleared of debris."
